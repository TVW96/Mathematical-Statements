# Mathematical Statements

## This file is ran from the Main.java file from within src directory. 

Assignment Overview:
In this hands-on assignment, you will create an application that interacts with users to evaluate logical operations on given inputs and generates truth tables. The application can be displayed on the web or in the terminal. The goal is to reinforce your understanding of conjunction, disjunction, negation, implication, and biconditional statements through practical implementation.

Objectives:
Implement logical operations (AND, OR, NOT, IF...THEN, IF AND ONLY IF) in a program.
Create a user interface (web or terminal) to accept inputs for A and B.
Display the results of the logical operations based on user inputs.
Generate a truth table showing all possible values of A and B and the results of logical operations.
Requirements:
User Input and Logical Operations:

Create a function to accept user inputs for A and B (either as boolean values or 0/1).
Implement functions to compute conjunction (AND), disjunction (OR), negation (NOT), implication (IF...THEN), and biconditional (IF AND ONLY IF).
Display the results of these operations based on the user inputs.
Truth Table Generation:

Implement a mode to generate and display a truth table.
The truth table should show all possible combinations of A and B and the corresponding results of the logical operations.
User Interface:

Design a user-friendly interface to interact with the application. This can be a web interface or a terminal interface
Ensure that the application is easy to navigate and provides clear instructions to the user.# Mathematical-Statements
