# Mathematical Statements

User Terminal application

1. Run file 'Main.java' to start program.
2. The program will ask for two boolean values to evaluate. Enter values for 'Input A' & 'Input B'. 
3. The program will display a results list for all possible logical operations using the given boolean values.
4. The program will display an illustration of a Truth Table.

## Assignment Instructions

Overview:
Create an application that interacts with users to evaluate logical operations on given inputs and generates truth tables. The application can be displayed on the web or in the terminal. The goal is to reinforce your understanding of **conjunction, disjunction, negation, implication, and biconditional** statements through practical implementation.

Objectives:
- Implement logical operations (AND, OR, NOT, IF...THEN, IF AND ONLY IF) in a program.
- Create a user interface (web or terminal) to accept inputs for A and B.
- Display the results of the logical operations based on user inputs.
- Generate a truth table showing all possible values of A and B and the results of logical operations.
